# CART-315-Prototype-3


This prototype's game files are too large to upload to GitHub so I've uploaded my most recent saves file to Google drive.

Prototype Hypothesis:

I want to watch players adapt to using a drift-centric driving style to navigate a course as fast as possible, improving their personal best time and experiencing "clutch" moments of gameplay.
I hope to discover the strengths and weakenesses of my prototype. I want to know how players feel about the mechanics of the car and the speed.
